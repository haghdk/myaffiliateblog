  "body": "I have chosen to start on affiliate marketing. The main reason of course being the possible extra income, but also because I really like generating traffic and looking at the different  sources and see how effective they all are. It's really fun to follow.\\\n\\\nIt can go both ways. It can be a tremendous failure and I have to give up at some point, but it can also be a great success and give me an extra income! I am ready to begin! :-)\\\n\\\nWhat I have realised is that is not as easy as it seems when watching YouTube videos. It's hard to find the right niche and find a way to promote it. But I am getting there steadily! :-)\n\n![No more money problems](/img/money-meme.png)",
